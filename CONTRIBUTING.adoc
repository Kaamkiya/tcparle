= Contributing

All contributions are welcome, whether it be documentation, making the code
more readable, adding features, fixing bugs, or anything else.

There are some guidelines, however.

== Guidelines

* All code must be properly formatted (do this with `go fmt ./...`) *before*
  making a pull request
* Make sure all code is *functional* before creating a pull request
* Code must be *readable*
* Comments should explain why something is done, not how
* For documentation: docs should be written in https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc]
