= tcparle

Chat over TCP. Name is TCP + "parle", which is French for talk.

You can connect with `telnet`:

[source,bash]
----
$ telnet $HOST:$PORT
----

Currently, it's built entirely with just the standard library.

== Commands

* `/room [room]`: Join a room. Rooms will be created if they do not exist. If
  no arguments are given, it will print your current room.
* `/rooms`: List all rooms.
* `/nick [name]`: Change your display name.
* `/quit`: Leave the chat

If you don't specify a command, whatever you type will be sent to everyone in
your room.

== Roadmap

* Color the usernames
* Add a `/help` command
* Delete empty rooms (except main)
* Validate room names
* Add a prompt with this format: `[user]:`
* Make a `/typing` command that gives a typing test and broadcasts user's
  results
